## SnakeCharmR

Modern overhaul of `rPython`.

You need a compiler and also these caveats:

### LINUX AND UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS

Package SnakeCharmR depends on Python (>= 2.7).

It requires both Python and its headers and libraries. These can be found in python and
python-dev packages in Debian-like Linux distributions.

In systems where several Python versions coexist, the user can choose the Python version
to use at installation time. By default, the package will be installed using the Python
version given by

    $ python --version

but it is possible to select a different one if the SNAKECHARMR_PYTHON_VERSION environment 
variable is appropriately set.

For instance, if it is defined as

    SNAKECHARMR_PYTHON_VERSION=3.2

it will try to use Python 3.2 (looking for python3.2 and python3.2-config in the path). If
set to

    SNAKECHARMR_PYTHON_VERSION=3

it will install against the "canonical" Python version in the system within the 3.x branch.


### WINDOWS SYSTEMS

In order to compile this on Windows, make sure you meet the following requirements:

* Install the latest version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/);

* Ensure the desired Python interpreter is the first one your PATH;

* Set PYTHONHOME environment variable for your user (or system-wide) correctly. If you are using the Python interpreter and libraries bundled with  Rtools mingw_64, for example, that would be `c:\Rtools\mingw_64\opt`;

* If you have more than one Python version installed and on your PATH, set the SNAKECHARMR_PYTHON_VERSION environment variable to the desired version. Ensure there's a loadable `libpython<version>.dll` in your system that matches this configured version. If you don't set this variable, an attempt will be made to determine this automatically with the Python interpreter major and minor versions.
