SnakeCharmR 1.0.4
=================
Fixed https://github.com/asieira/SnakeCharmR/issues/24. Thanks to David Severski (@dseverski)
for reporting this.


SnakeCharmR 1.0.3
=================
Took measures to ensure SnakeCharmR will work properly on systems where the native encoding is not UTF-8:

* Use Python API to check if variable is str/bytes or unicode and handling things correctly. In particular, when we read Python unicode values we flag the resulting R string as UTF-8 since that’s what we Python C API we are using will return;

* Ensure that Python code being executed is converted to UTF-8 and that the Python interpreter is made aware of that according to PEP 263.


SnakeCharmR 1.0.2
=================
Fixed linking and building errors on some platforms (such as Amazon Linux) by updating the
autoconf file to use the correct C++ compiler preferred by R.


SnakeCharmR 1.0.1
=================
Fixed handling of NULL values in arguments, including a workaround for jeroenooms/jsonlite#130 which was causing inconsistencies.


SnakeCharmR 1.0.0
=================
Initial release.
